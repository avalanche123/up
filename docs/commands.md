# Commands

Commands implemented by `up` are categorized into groups with increasing levels
of specificity. This `up <noun-0>...<noun-N> <verb> [args...]` style caters to
simple discovery and a clearer mapping to REST API endpoints with which the CLI
interacts.

Groups:
- [Top-Level](#top-level)
- [Cloud](#cloud)
  - [Control Plane](#subgroup-control-plane)
- [UXP](#uxp)

## Top-Level

**Commands**

Top-level commands do not belong in any subgroup, and are generally used to
configure `up` itself.

Format: `up <cmd> ...`

- `license`
    - Behavior: Prints license information for the `up` binary, which is under
      the [Upbound Software License].

**Flags:**

Top-level flags can be passed for any top-level or group-specific command.

- `-h,--help`: Print help and exit.
- `-v,--version`: Print current `up` version and exit.

## Cloud

Format: `up cloud <cmd> ...`

Commands in the **Cloud** group are used to interact with Upbound Cloud.

- `login`
    - Flags:
        - `-p,--password = STRING` (Env: `UP_PASS`): Password for specified
          user. If `-` is given the value will be read from stdin.
        - `-t,--token = STRING` (Env: `UP_TOKEN`): Upbound API token used to
          perform the login. If `-` is given the value will be read from stdin.
        - `-u,--username = STRING` (Env: `UP_USER`): User with which to perform
          the login. Email can also be used as username.
    - Behavior: Acquires a session token based on the provided information. If
      only username is provided, the user will be prompted for a password. If
      neither username or password is provided, the user will be prompted for
      both. If token is provided, the user will not be prompted for input. The
      acquired session token will be stored in `~/.up/config.json`. Interactive
      input is disabled if stdin is not an interactive terminal.
- `logout`
    - Behavior: Invalidates the session token for the default profile or one
      specified with `--profile`.

**Group Flags**

Group flags can be passed for any command in the **Cloud** group. Some commands
may choose not to utilize the group flags when not relevant.

- `-a,--account = STRING` (Env: `UP_ACCOUNT`): Account with which to perform the
  specified command. Can be either an organization or a personal account.
- `--endpoint = URL` (Env: `UP_ENDPOINT`) (Default: `https://api.upbound.io`):
  Endpoint to use when communicating with the Upbound API.
- `--profile = STRING` (Env: `UP_PROFILE`); Profile with which to perform the
  specified command.

### Subgroup: Control Plane

Format: `up cloud controlplane <cmd> ...` Alias: `up cloud xp <cmd> ...`

- `attach <name>`
    - Flags:
      - `-d,--description = STRING`: Control plane description.
      - `--kube-cluster-id = UUID`: UUID for self-hosted control plane.
        Auto-populated as `metadata.uid` of `kube-system` `Namespace` of
        currently configured `kubeconfig` if not manually provided.
      - `--kubeconfig = STRING`: sets `kubeconfig` path. Same defaults as
        `kubectl` are used if not provided.
      - `--view-only`: creates the self-hosted control plane as view only.
    - Behavior: Creates a self-hosted control plane on Upbound Cloud and returns
      token to connect a UXP instance to it.
- `create <name>`
    - Flags:
        - `--description = STRING`: Control plane description.
    - Behavior: Creates a hosted control plane on Upbound Cloud.
- `delete <id>`
    - Behavior: Deletes a control plane on Upbound Cloud. If control plane is
      hosted, the UXP cluster will be deleted. If the control plane is
      self-hosted, the UXP cluster will begin failing to connect to Upbound
      Cloud.
- `list`
    - Behavior: Lists all control planes for the
      configured account.

## UXP

Format: `up uxp <cmd> ...`

Commands in the **UXP** group are used to install and manage Upbound Universal
Crossplane, as well as connect it to Upbound Cloud.

- `install [version]`
    - Flags:
        - `--unstable = BOOL`: Allows installing unstable UXP versions. If using
          Helm as install engine, setting to `true` will use
          https://charts.upbound.io/main as repository instead of
          https://charts.upbound.io/stable.
        - `--set = KEY=VALUE`: Set install parameters for UXP. Flag can be
          passed multiple times and multiple key-value pairs can be provided in
          a comma-separated list.
        - `-f,--file = FILE`: YAML file with parameters for UXP install. Follows
          format of Helm-style values file.
    - Behavior: Installs UXP into cluster specified by currently configured
      `kubeconfig`. When using Helm as install engine, the command mirrors the
      behavior of `helm install`. If `[version]` is not provided, the latest
      chart version will be used from the either the stable or unstable
      repository.
- `connect <control-plane-token>`
    - Flags:
      - `--token-secret-name` (Default: `upbound-control-plane-token`): Sets the
        name of the secret that will be used to store the control plane token in
        the configured Kubernetes cluster.
    - Behavior: Connects the UXP instance in cluster specified by currently
      configured `kubeconfig` to the existing self-hosted control plane
      specified by `<control-plane-token>`. If `-` is given for
      `<control-plane-token>` the value will be read from stdin.
- `upgrade [version]` 
    - Flags:
        - `--rollback = BOOL`: Indicates that the upgrade should be rolled back
          in case of failure.
        - `--unstable = BOOL`: Allows installing unstable UXP versions. If using
          Helm as install engine, setting to `true` will use
          https://charts.upbound.io/main as repository instead of
          https://charts.upbound.io/stable.
        - `--set = KEY=VALUE`: Set install parameters for UXP. Flag can be
          passed multiple times and multiple key-value pairs can be provided in
          a comma-separated list.
        - `-f,--file = FILE`: YAML file with parameters for UXP install. Follows
          format of Helm-style values file.
        - `--force = BOOL`: Forces upgrade even if versions are incompatible.
          This is only relevant when upgrading from Crossplane to UXP. 
    - Behavior: Upgrades UXP in cluster specified by currently configured
      `kubeconfig` in the specified namespace. If `[version]` is not provided,
      the latest chart version will be used from the either the stable or
      unstable repository. This command can also be used to upgrade a currently
      installed Crossplane version to a _compatible UXP version_ (i.e. one that
      has the same major, minor, and patch version). The following scenarios are
      supported when upgrading from Crossplane `vX.Y.Z` installed in the
      `crossplane-system` namespace:
        - `up uxp upgrade vX.Y.Z-up.N -n crossplane-system`: upgrades Crossplane
          to compatible UXP version in the same namespace.
        - `up uxp upgrade vA.B.C-up.N -n crossplane-system --force`: upgrades
          Crossplane to an incompatible UXP version in the same namespace.
        - `up uxp upgrade -n crossplane-system --force`: upgrades Crossplane to
          an incompatible latest stable version of UXP in the same namespace.
        - `up uxp upgrade vX.Y.Z-up.N.rc.xyz -n crossplane-system --unstable`:
          upgrades Crossplane to a compatible unstable version of UXP in the
          same namespace.
        - `up uxp upgrade vA.B.C-up.N.rc.xyz -n crossplane-system --unstable
          --force`: upgrades Crossplane to a incompatible unstable version of
          UXP in the same namespace.
        - `up uxp upgrade -n crossplane-system --unstable --force`: upgrades
          Crossplane to an incompatible latest unstable version of UXP in the
          same namespace.
- `uninstall` 
    - Behavior: Uninstalls UXP from the cluster specified by currently
      configured `kubeconfig`.

**Group Flags**

Group flags can be passed for any command in the **UXP** group. Some commands
may choose not to utilize the group flags when not relevant.

- `--kubeconfig = STRING`: sets `kubeconfig` path. Same defaults as `kubectl`
  are used if not provided.
- `-n,--namespace = STRING` (Env: `UXP_NAMESPACE`) (Default: `upbound-system`):
  Kubernetes namespace used for installing and managing UXP.
